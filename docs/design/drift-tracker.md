# Drift Tracker / Open Questions

This file tracks unresolved specs, known gaps, and items we still need to converge.

- Numeric grammar: we still need a clear spec and tests for decimals and scientific notation.
- String escape grammar: escape rules and invalid-character handling still need to be specified precisely.
- Identifier policy: charset scope and normalization strategy still need to be defined.
- Postfix parity: postfix validation still needs to converge with inference/completion behavior (see `docs/design/builtins-and-types.md`).
